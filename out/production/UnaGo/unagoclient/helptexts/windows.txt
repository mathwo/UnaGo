Using Windows

Many details depend on your operation system.

UnaGo keeps the sizes and positions of the windows in a file named
GO.CFG. It tries to write the file into the active directory. So you
need write access to this directory. In multi-user environments, you
should set up a local UnaGo directory for each user with an
installation script. Then a script can start UnaGo from this directory.
You pass the UnaGo directory as an argument with parameter -home.

Most systems allow cut and paste from text fields. In Windows, use
CNTRL-C to copy text from anywhere to the clipboard and CONTRL-V to
paste it into a UnaGo input field. Or use the right mouse button to get
a menu for copying. UnaGo is using a replacement for the text areas,
unless you have chosen the normal text areas in the advanced options
menu. This allows colored output and has no size limit. the
replacement can copy to the clipboard.

Dialog windows can be closed with the Escape key, if they have the
keyboard focus.

The text input fields, which send commands to the server, have a
history. You can recall old commands with the Cursor Up key.
